 Take Home Assignment for Interview


# Requirements
 With your own preferred language and framework, build a web application to:
 
 ● Display a table of 50 medications from the attached JSON file. The table should have 5
  columns: Category, Name, Dose, Description, and Cost.
 
 ● Filter medications based on their categories.
 
 ● Search for medications based on their name. The search should be text-based -
  meaning the user should be able to search with any substring of the name.
  
  
  
# Notes
 ● The main purpose of this assignment is to evaluate your programming skill so there is no
  right or wrong. Feel free to design and implement the app the way you like.
 
 ● You must be able to demo the application and talk about your code during the interview.
  Asking for help from friends or StackOverflow is fine as long as you understand the
  code.
  


# Bonus
 CyberPatient always looks for overachievers. You can get some bonus points if:
 
 ● Your solution includes both backend and frontend.
 
 ● Your solution is extensible with a larger number of medications. Some considerations are
  pagination or lazy loading.
 
 ● You can add some unit tests to the application.
